Welcome to the blog portion of my website!

Here you can find a number of pages I wrote on various coding-related topics. Specifcally, I created these pages for the following two reasons:

1. Project Insights: The first primary objective of these pages is to offer a deeper look into the projects I've worked on. While the main section of my portfolio provides a brief overview of each project, here I can provide more details on the project itself and its development process.
2. Code Examples: The second primary objective is to provide and explain code snippets from my projects. These are designed to both show off some of the systems I've designed and provide insights into my software design process.

If you need somewhere to start, you can find a list of pages on my major projects below:
